The following is the workflow to obtain the otu's and related statistics
for people with microbiome data on the PGP. In the future, I plan on combining this
all in a single script

-------------
PREPROCESSING
-------------
For peoples suffering a disorder (This example uses IBS)
1. Get patient survey
2. Retrieve the html file of using wget with the url
3. Extract the patient Id's from the html file using the following command

   grep '/profile/*' html_file | cut -d">" -f2 | cut -d/ -f3 | cut -d"\"" -f1 > outfile.txt

4. use auto_dl.sh to retrieve html files from the server. will use outfile.txt
   ./auto_dl.sh
5. Remake outfile.txt to only include html files relating to pations
   ls | grep '^hu*' > outfile.txt
6. use retrieve_data.sh to download the datasets, parsing the html files
   ./retrieve_data.sh
7. remove all html files
   rm ????????
8. create a list of data files
   ls *.data > in
9. unzip all the files using unzip_patients.pl
   perl unzip_patients.pl
10. remove all archives
   rm *.data
11. Create a list of all data directories
   ls -d ???????? > links
12. Compile all OTU files
   perl process_tables.pl links

POSTPROCESSING
--------------

1. Transfer all of the OTU files to a single directory
2. Within R, transverse to that directory and run generateplots.R
3. This will give you 3 cluster plots for each OTU
