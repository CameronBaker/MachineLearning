The following is the workflow to obtain the otu's and related statistics
for people with microbiome data on the PGP. In the future, I plan on combining this
all in a single script

-------------
PREPROCESSING
-------------
For peoples suffering a disorder (This example uses IBS)
1. Get patient survey
2. Read survey to determine a target disorder
3. Collect subset of CSV relating to that disorder
   grep "IBS" dig_survey > IBS_patients.csv
4. use get_patient.pl to extract the patient id's. will write to outfile.txt
   perl get_patient.pl patient_survey
5. use auto_dl.sh to retrieve html files from the server. will use outfile.txt
   ./auto_dl.sh
6. Remake outfile.txt to only include html files relating to pations
   ls | grep '^hu*' > outfile.txt
7. use retrieve_data.sh to download the datasets, parsing the html files
   ./retrieve_data.sh
8. remove all html files
   rm ????????
9. unzip all datafiles
   unzip '*.data'
10. remove all archives
   rm *.data
11. obtain a list of directories containing the data
   ls | grep '_results' > outfile.txt
12. obtain the data tables from within the directories
   ./ret_tables.sh
13. iterate through files, writing important data to 

If retrieving info on all datasets
1. Retrieve the html file of using wget with the url
2. Extract the patient Id's from the html file using the following command

   grep '/profile/*' html_filename | grep -Po '".?"' | grep -v "width" | grep -v "participant" | cut -d '"' -f 2 | cut -d '/' -f 3 > outfile.txt

3. continue along the same procedure as above, starting from step 5

POSTPROCESSING
--------------

1. Transfer all of the OTU files to a single directory
2. Within R, transverse to that directory and run generateplots.R
3. This will give you 3 cluster plots for each OTU
